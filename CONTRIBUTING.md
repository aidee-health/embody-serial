# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [MIT license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11+ and the following tools:

- [UV] - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- [tox] - Standardized testing in Python

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ make install
```

This will set up your environment using UV and install pre-commit hooks.

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ uv run python
$ uv run embody-serial
```

[tox]: https://tox.wiki/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite using the Makefile:

```console
$ make test
```

For more complex testing across multiple Python versions, use tox:

```console
$ tox
```

List the available tox environments:

```console
$ tox --listenvs
```

You can also run a specific tox environment:

```console
$ tox -e py312
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The test suite must pass without errors and warnings across all supported Python versions.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains high code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can use:

```console
$ make check
```

Pre-commit hooks are installed automatically when you run `make install`, ensuring code quality checks run before each commit.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## Using the Makefile

This project includes a Makefile with convenient shortcuts for common development tasks:

| Command            | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make install`     | Set up the development environment and install pre-commit hooks |
| `make check`       | Run code quality checks (linting, formatting)                   |
| `make test`        | Run the test suite with pytest                                  |
| `make build`       | Build the package (wheel and sdist)                             |
| `make clean-build` | Remove build artifacts                                          |
| `make help`        | Display all available commands                                  |
